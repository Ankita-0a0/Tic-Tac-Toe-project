# Tic-Tac-Toe-project
The Tic Tac Toe project in Java is a simple console-based game that allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns selecting their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their marker (either 'X' or 'O'). The game checks for win conditions after each turn, determining if a player has aligned three markers in a row, column, or diagonal. It also detects ties when the grid is full without any winners. The project emphasizes object-oriented programming principles, utilizing classes for game logic, player management, and the game board. With clear input validation and user-friendly prompts, it provides an engaging experience for players of all ages. The project can be extended with features like a graphical user interface (GUI) or an AI opponent for enhanced gameplay.
